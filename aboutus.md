TSRS is owned and operated by Eric and Cynthia Foster who have a wide variety of musical and creative experience from nerdcore to classical, comics to photography. Eric is a multi-instrumentalist who grew up in DFW – he’ll be running the show at TSRS on a day-to-day basis. Cynthia moved to Denton to play the double-bass at UNT, but eventually went on to get her MBA and now works in the aerospace industry. They love to play music with their teenaged son, and constantly explore new mediums of expression. Eric and Cynthia are so passionate about this project, they sold their house to fund TSRS, and are looking forward to giving back to the Denton music and art scene.
